We imported `useState`, `useEffect`  hooks alongside with React. We also imported dummyData, stylesheet from data.js and app.css files respectively. App.css is currently empty but will be updated as we proceed.

We created a `Card` component and deconstructed the `item` and `channel` props so it can be used across the Card component. Each `Card` item component that displays one video will show a thumbnail, views, published date, and title.

Next, we created a `CardList` Component, what this component does is to map through our items array and return the Card component with its props.

Since our data is dummy, we need to mock it like API data by loading contents after a two-second timeout using the JavaScript setTimeout method;
And lastly, we created our App component, which holds a video state and sets the state to an empty array, to load our dummy data weâ€™ll make use of the useEffect hook. 
In our hook we created a variable timer that holds the setTimeout function, inside the function we set our video state to our dummyData object, we ensure that the data loads after 2s and lastly we canceled the timer while unmounting.

 Finally, we map through our video state and return a section element that contains the list-section, the CardList component with its list props.
